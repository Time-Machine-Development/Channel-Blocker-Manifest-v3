# Channel-Blocker

A web extension allowing you to block YouTubeâ„¢ videos and comments by blacklisting users and/or by using regular expressions.

### About this extension

Our Add-on enables the function of blocking anything you'd like. Block separate videos, users or whole channels with only one click! Naturally, the add-on supports regular expressions to ensure you the best customisation possible. And another thing: no user information is collected.
